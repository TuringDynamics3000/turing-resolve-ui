### Idea 1: "The Glass Fortress" (Neo-Brutalist Transparency)

**Design Movement:** Neo-Brutalism meets Glassmorphism
**Core Principles:**
1. **Radical Transparency:** Everything is visible, nothing is hidden. The UI feels like looking into a clear, secure vault.
2. **Structural Integrity:** Heavy, bold typography and thick borders convey the "frozen" nature of the ledger.
3. **Evidence-First:** Data is not just displayed; it's presented as evidence. Every data point feels weighty.
4. **Clinical Precision:** The interface feels like a high-end medical or scientific instrument.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Monochrome Foundation:** Stark blacks, whites, and grays to represent the immutable ledger.
- **Signal Colors:** Sharp, high-contrast neon accents (Cyber Yellow, Signal Green, Alert Red) used *only* for decision outcomes.
- **Intent:** To convey absolute certainty and lack of ambiguity.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Split-Screen Timeline:** A vertical timeline on the left (the "Story") and a detailed evidence panel on the right (the "Proof").
- **Card-Based Evidence:** Each piece of evidence is a distinct "card" with a physical feel (shadows, borders).
- **No Floating Elements:** Everything is anchored and grid-aligned, reinforcing stability.

**Signature Elements:**
- **"The Seal":** A digital wax seal visual for finalized decisions.
- **Monospace Data:** All ledger data is rendered in a high-quality monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono).
- **Frosted Glass Overlays:** Used for drill-down details, suggesting looking "deeper" into the data.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **"Heavy" Clicks:** Buttons have significant press states. Interactions feel substantial.
- **Hover-to-Reveal:** Hovering over a decision reveals the underlying policy rules in a detailed popover (not a tooltip).
- **Scrubbable Timeline:** Users can scrub through the decision history like a video editor.

**Animation:**
- **Snap Transitions:** No soft fades. Things snap into place with mechanical precision.
- **Typewriter Effect:** For explaining decisions, text appears character-by-character (fast).

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** *Space Grotesk* (Bold, uppercase, tight tracking).
- **Body:** *Inter* (Clean, legible).
- **Data:** *JetBrains Mono* (For all ledger values).

### Idea 2: "The Weaver's Loom" (Interconnected Threads)

**Design Movement:** Data Visualization Art / Generative Design
**Core Principles:**
1. **Causality:** Show *why* things happened by visualizing the connections between facts and decisions.
2. **Flow:** The UI emphasizes the flow of data from the ledger to the decision engine.
3. **Organic Logic:** Decisions aren't just boxes; they are the result of converging streams of information.
4. **Human-Centric:** Focus on the narrative of the decision for the human investigator.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Deep Ocean Background:** Dark blues and teals to represent the depth of the ledger.
- **Thread Colors:** Distinct pastel threads for different policy types (AML, Fraud, Credit).
- **Intent:** To make complex logic feel approachable and interconnected.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Node-Link Diagram:** The central view is a graph of the decision logic, not a list.
- **Sidebar Inspector:** Clicking a node opens a detailed inspector on the side.
- **Horizontal Flow:** Time flows left to right, with decisions emerging from the data stream.

**Signature Elements:**
- **Bezier Curves:** Connecting lines are smooth curves, not sharp angles.
- **Glowing Nodes:** Active decision points glow softly.
- **Particle Effects:** Subtle particles flow along the lines to show data movement.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Explore-by-Touch:** The graph is interactive; users can drag nodes and zoom in/out.
- **Focus Mode:** Clicking a thread dims everything else to highlight that specific policy path.
- **Drill-Down:** Double-clicking a node expands it into its constituent rules.

**Animation:**
- **Flowing Lines:** Data streams animate along the connections.
- **Bloom Effects:** Nodes bloom when selected.
- **Smooth Zoom:** Seamless transitions between high-level and detailed views.

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** *Outfit* (Geometric, friendly).
- **Body:** *DM Sans* (Humanist, readable).
- **Data:** *Fira Code* (with ligatures).

### Idea 3: "The Swiss Vault" (Minimalist Authority)

**Design Movement:** International Typographic Style (Swiss Style)
**Core Principles:**
1. **Hierarchy:** Absolute clarity of information hierarchy. The most important information is undeniable.
2. **Grid Systems:** A strict, visible modular grid that governs all placement.
3. **Objective Truth:** The design tries to be invisible, letting the facts speak for themselves.
4. **Timelessness:** The UI looks like it could exist in 1960 or 2060.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Paper White / Off-White:** A warm, paper-like background.
- **Ink Black:** Text is stark black.
- **Swiss Red:** Used sparingly for alerts and critical failures.
- **Intent:** To convey institutional authority and archival permanence.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Asymmetric Grid:** Content is balanced but not centered. Heavy use of negative space.
- **Typographic Scale:** Massive font size differences to denote importance.
- **Vertical Rhythm:** Strict baseline alignment.

**Signature Elements:**
- **Thick Rules:** Heavy horizontal lines separating sections.
- **Oversized Numbers:** Decision scores or IDs are rendered very large.
- **Iconography:** Minimal, geometric icons (if any).

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Instant Response:** No lag, no "heavy" animations. Instant state changes.
- **Keyboard First:** Power users can navigate entirely via keyboard shortcuts.
- **Contextual Drawers:** Details slide out from the side, preserving context.

**Animation:**
- **Slide and Reveal:** Panels slide in from off-screen.
- **Minimal Motion:** Only used for state changes (e.g., a toggle switch).

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** *Helvetica Now* (or *Inter* with tight tracking if Helvetica unavailable).
- **Body:** *Roboto* (Neutral).
- **Data:** *Roboto Mono*.
