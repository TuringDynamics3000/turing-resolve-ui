## PAGE 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1. Risk Brain Status

| Domain | Shadow Active | CI Harness | Kill-Switch Activations |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Payments RL | ✅ ON | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Fraud | ✅ ON | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| AML | ✅ ON | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Treasury RL | ✅ ON | ✅ PASS | 0 |

✅ **All four B-domains are actively running in shadow mode with clean CI and no kill-switch events.**

### 2. Safety & Governance

| Invariant | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| AI-Origin Execution Violations | 0 |
| Schema Violations | 0 |
| Policy Origin Violations | 0 |

✅ **Declarative Safety Attestation (MANDATORY):**

*"No AI-origin execution attempts were detected. No AI-controlled financial actions occurred during this reporting period."*

### 3. Key Weekly Movements (Auto-Narrative)

**Payments RL:** 71.8% of all network payments evaluated by RL in shadow; optimisation signal trending positive.

**Fraud:** No systemic anomaly clusters; isolated merchant-level spikes investigated.

**AML:** Medium-risk behavioural alerts elevated in two jurisdictions; structure consistent with seasonal retail flows.

**Treasury:** No projected liquidity stress beyond existing intraday governance buffers.

## PAGE 2 — PAYMENTS RL (SHADOW)

### Coverage

- **% of Payments Evaluated by RL:** 71.8%
- **Total Payments Analysed (7d):** 14,892

### Directional Benefit Split

| Direction | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| RL Better | 8,412 |
| RL Worse | 1,103 |
| Neutral | 5,377 |

**Net Optimisation Signal:** Strongly Positive

### Board Interpretation (Auto-Text)

*"Shadow RL suggests that a majority of evaluated payments would have benefitted from alternative routing, timing, or rail selection. The optimisation signal remains net-positive with no observed systemic latency regression."*

## PAGE 3 — FRAUD SHADOW

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| High-Risk Flags (7d) | 37 |
| Confirmed Fraud | 4 |
| Cleared | 28 |
| Pending Investigation | 5 |

### Narrative:

*"Fraud activity remained within baseline volatility. No network-wide merchant, IP cluster, or device-reuse escalation detected. Observed confirmed cases were isolated to known risk corridors."*

---

## PAGE 4 — AML SHADOW

### Risk Flags (per 1,000 Accounts)

| Risk Band | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| High | 7 |
| Medium | 49 |

### Outcomes

| Outcome | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Investigations Opened | 6 |
| SMRs Filed | 1 |

### Narrative:

*"Behavioural AML risk remains stable. Medium-band alerts reflect expected seasonal cross-border remittance patterns. No clustering indicative of organised structuring detected."*

---

## PAGE 5 — TREASURY RL (SHADOW)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| High-Risk Liquidity Windows | 0 |
| Avg Recommended Buffer Uplift | A$184,200 |
| Peak Intraday Stress Score | 0.41 (Threshold = 0.70) |

### Narrative:

*"No liquidity stress events are forecast beyond current governance thresholds. Shadow RL continues to recommend modest precautionary buffer increases aligned with settlement concentration timing."*
