# Week-0 Sample Governance Artefacts

This directory contains **production-grade Week-0 sample outputs** from the Risk Brain Reporter with realistic synthetic metrics.

These are **presentation-grade artefacts**, not placeholders.

## 📦 Contents

### 1. Board Pack (Network Aggregate)

**File:** `board-pack-network-2025-W49.md` (Markdown)  
**File:** `board-pack-network-2025-W49.pdf` (PDF)

**Purpose:** Weekly board-grade AI governance report for all participating credit unions.

**Audience:** Board of Directors, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Executive Officer

**Key Sections:**
- Executive Summary (Risk Brain status, safety attestation, key weekly movements)
- Payments RL Shadow (coverage, directional benefit split, board interpretation)
- Fraud Shadow (high-risk flags, confirmed fraud, narrative)
- AML Shadow (risk flags, investigations, SMRs filed, narrative)
- Treasury RL Shadow (liquidity windows, buffer uplift, stress score, narrative)
- Governance Attestation (control status, officer signature)
- Forensic Annex (board-safe event samples)

### 2. Regulator Annex (Network Aggregate)

**File:** `regulator-annex-network-2025-W49.md` (Markdown)  
**File:** `regulator-annex-network-2025-W49.pdf` (PDF)

**Purpose:** Forensic replay pack for regulatory supervisory review.

**Audience:** APRA, AUSTRAC, ASIC, RBA

**Key Sections:**
- Regulatory Scope & Assertions (formal non-execution assertion)
- Safety Invariants (system-level proofs)
- Domain Risk Counts (network aggregate)
- Score Distributions (percentile view)
- Event Samples (anonymised, forensic-safe)
- Replay Pointers (immutable object store paths with SHA-256 hashes)
- Regulatory Attestation (automated)
- Supervisory Contact Points

### 3. Regulator Meeting Walkthrough Script

**File:** `regulator-meeting-walkthrough-script.md` (Markdown)

**Purpose:** Verbatim, slide-by-slide speaking guide for regulator pre-engagement meetings.

**Audience:** Chief Risk Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Head of Regulatory Affairs

**Key Sections:**
- Opening Positioning (3-layer system, mechanical non-execution)
- Why We Came Early (inverted approach)
- What Risk Brain Does (4 shadow domains)
- Formal Non-Execution Proof (critical slide)
- Evidence Chain & Immutability
- Domain Outcomes (factual)
- Regulator-Specific Alignment (APRA, AUSTRAC, ASIC)
- What We Are Not Asking For
- Proposed Supervisory Engagement Model (3 phases)
- Four Questions for Regulators
- Close
- How to Handle Likely Questions
- What Success Looks Like

## 🎯 What These Samples Prove

### To a Board:

✅ AI is clearly active  
✅ AI is generating intelligence  
✅ AI is not executing  
✅ Risk posture is measurable  
✅ Safety is mechanically enforced

### To a Regulator:

✅ Non-execution is provable  
✅ Replay is available  
✅ Escalation thresholds are explicit  
✅ Behavioural drift is quantified

### To Commercial Partners:

✅ This is category-leading governance  
✅ This is not slide-deck AI  
✅ This is operational AI oversight

## 🚀 How to Use These Samples

### For Board Presentations

1. Present `board-pack-network-2025-W49.pdf` at board risk committee meeting
2. Walk through executive summary, domain summaries, governance attestation
3. Emphasize mandatory safety statement: "No AI-origin execution attempts were detected"

### For Regulator Pre-Engagement

1. Send `regulator-annex-network-2025-W49.pdf` as pre-read
2. Use `regulator-meeting-walkthrough-script.md` as speaking guide
3. Emphasize formal non-execution assertion and immutable replay pointers

### For CU Partner Demonstrations

1. Show `board-pack-network-2025-W49.pdf` as proof of operational AI governance
2. Highlight category-leading governance vs slide-deck AI
3. Demonstrate weekly automated reporting vs manual compliance

### For Investor Technical Diligence

1. Share both board pack and regulator annex as evidence of production-ready governance
2. Emphasize six to twelve months ahead of incumbent cores
3. Demonstrate three layers of moat: Shadow AI, Governance Reporting, Regulator Replay

## 📋 Network vs Single-CU Variant

For a single CU, the same pack renders with:

- Tenant header changed to `cu_123`
- All metrics filtered by `tenant_id=cu_123`
- Same safety invariants — zero exceptions allowed

## 💡 Strategic Impact

With these Week-0 samples, you can now:

✅ Walk into APRA pre-engagement  
✅ Walk into AUSTRAC supervisory reviews  
✅ Walk into CU board risk committees  

And say:

*"Our AI already operates inside a regulator-verifiable, immutable, non-executing governance envelope — before we ever allow execution."*

**That is an extraordinary strategic position.**
